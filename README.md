# web_scraper_live_demo

This is the code for the "Build a Web Scraper" Live stream by @Sirajology on Youtube

# Overview

This is the code for the live [Youtube](https://youtu.be/A0Ac_dKNmH0) session I hosted on how to build a web scraper. 
This script pulls the top 20 most frequently used words from a Wikipedia article. 
It uses regular expressions and stop word removal to create a cleaned table that we can view with the results

# Installation

The necessary dependencies are in the requirements.txt file so just run this before running the actual code to get them installed

``
pip install -r requirements.txt
``

# Usage

There are two arguments. 
The first is the article you want to retrive words from. 
The second is a boolean value that describes whether or not you want to remove stop words. 

``
python main.py your_article_name_here yes
``
